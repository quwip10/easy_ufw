# easy_ufw
Interactive UFW Script. Great for managing Ubuntu VMs
Currently walks a user through adding new UFW rules.
Works great for beginners and those unfamiliar with UFW syntax.
Users only have to know Source and Destination IPs/Ports.

A future enhancement will add automation to read from a file/repository
and load common rules. This is especially useful when managing multiple VMs
that will all have many of the same rules.
